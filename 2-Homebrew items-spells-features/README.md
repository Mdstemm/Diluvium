<h2>Proficiency Dice</h2>
<p>Insted of adding your proficiency modifyer you can roll an aditioal dice based on the following table:</p>

| Level | dice |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1-4   | d4   |
| 5-8   | d6   |
| 9-12  | d8   |
| 13-16 | d10  |
| 17-20 | d12  |

<h2>Death/Lasting injuries</h2>

<h3>Diying</h3>

When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

You also die if you roll 3 failed death saves.

### Lasting injuries

Otherwise the excess damage is added to a d100 roll that will determine the effect or Lasting injuries you suffer. 

To recover from a Lasting injuries roll a Wisdom (Medicine) with the heal check DC. Magical healing grants advantage and allows rolling with spellcasting modifier. Performing Wisdom(Medicine) on yourself causes disadvantage. A heal check can be attempted once per long rest.

Unless otherwise stated you still roll death saves every turn until dead or stabilized.

Heal check key: 

> Number = recovery difficulty or stabilization difficulty
> 
> X = no recovery
> 
> SR = recovered via short rest
> 
> LR = recovered via long rest
> 
> \* = requires magical healing

Keep in mind that an X isn't an end all, you may just have to get creative to fix it in the long term.

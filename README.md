# Diluvium

A Fantasy world I'm building for a game and creative outlet

<p</p>

<p>The main branch has all the information that is known by the players, a GM-* branch is for adding learned information, and the GM-all contains all written lore.</p><br>

<p>The world of Diluvium is a chaotic and intertwined world. There are eight major countries and nine prominent city states. <a href="https://github.com/Mdstemm/Diluvium/tree/main/0-World%20Lore%2C%20People%2C%20and%20places/Governments"> Govenments</a>
</p>

<p>
The world is relatively peaceful having recently emerged from a rebellion in Oxlightian Kingdom. While the countries each claim vast lands their control is often limited leaving enforcement to local towns. Because of this many paths are peppered with bandits, monsters, and other hindrances that convinced the average person to stay within their bounds. 
</p>
<p>This story however is not about some average people, it's about adventures. These adventures come from humble origins. But just how far will they rise?</p>

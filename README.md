# Diluvium

<p>A DnD world I'm building for a game and creative outlet</p>

<p>The main branch has all the information that is known by the players, a DM-* branch is for adding learned information, and the DM-all contains all written lore.</p><br>

The world of Diluvium is a chaotic and intertwined world. There are eight major countries and several prominent city states.
